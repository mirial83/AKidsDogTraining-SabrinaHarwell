## Spay/Neuter Contract
Intact animals will not properly alert when other intact animals are present. To prevent this, all animals participating in training and fostering for service animals must, under no uncertain conditions, be spayed or neutered. Agreement to this contract indicates agreement by owner to spay or neuter their animal at the owner’s expense. If the animal is not spayed or neutered upon entering this contract, all veterinary expenses associated with spaying or neutering the animal will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees.
## Animal’s Medical Requirements
All service animals and animals in training must be up to date on all wormings, flea and tick control, heartworm medication and shots. It is the owner’s responsibility to ensure that their service animal remains compliant with these laws both during and after training and fostering. Any fees to comply with such laws during training and fostering will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees.

Any animal, as in any human, will have additional medical needs outside of vaccination. It is the owner’s responsibility to cover these medical fees during and after training and fostering. Any additional veterinary expenses will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees.

Animal will be provided the same nutrition as all other animals in the foster residence unless ordered by a veterinarian. If special diet is prescribed, the cost of the special diet will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees.

It is the owner’s option to provide veterinary insurance for their service dog. If insurance is being provided, all information regarding the policy must be provided to the trainer/fosterer.
## Initial Training Level Determination
All animals will have an initial evaluation at the start of training and fostering to determine current skill levels. Training will progress starting at their existing proficiency level and will include the following skills:
Basic Obedience: Sit, Stay, Down, Leave It, Off, Loose Leash Walking, Back Off, Coming to their name, Here (moving to a designated spot), OK (release to eat), Paw, Up (jumping up to a seat), Spot, Drop It
Canine Good Citizen Skills: Accepting a friendly stranger, sitting politely for petting, walking through a crowd, chain of sit down and stay, polite reaction to another dog, no reaction to distraction or loud noises, supervised separation
Intermediate Obedience: touching a designated spot, pick it up, bring it, pushing a button or light switch, pushing a door closed, front paws on lap or legs, bark on cue, sit between legs when not moving (sitting or standing outside of house), push doorbell next to door to go outside, open door using a pull
Alert Skills: scratching at leg while standing, front paws on lap or side of legs while seated, bark (action when you don’t respond to earlier alerts), finding a responsive adult when incapacitated
Series skills 1: open door, pick it up, close door, bring it, drop it
Series skills 2: scratch at leg or front paws on leg, bark

## Determination of Moving to Next Level of Training
All skills of previous level must be mastered before advancing. Order of Training Levels are as follows: Basic Obedience, Canine Good Citizen Skills, Intermediate Obedience, Alert Skills, Series Skills.

There will be one formal test required in the middle of the training, the Canine Good Citizen Test. A pass on this test is required prior to advancing to Intermediate Obedience.

Success rates must be at 9 out of 10 attempts for 7 days straight in order to be considered as mastered.
## Owner Requirements for Continued Training
Diabetic alert dogs require samples to be provided on a regular basis during training to continue with alert training phase. Collection containers and instructions will be shipped when needed. The cost for these materials and shipping will be the responsibility of the owner, and these costs will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees. The total number of samples required depends on the length of time the animal is in their alert training phase and later.
## Owner Requirements for Release
There is an inherent risk associated with the ownership of any animal. Since service animals are in public on a regular basis, it is the owner’s responsibility to obtain insurance that will cover not just the animal in case of any emergency, but also to protect the owner in case of an unintentional injury to a third party.

The owner must obtain certain skills to be able to handle a service animal. These skills include being able to loose leash walk a dog, provide simple commands to a dog, and follow precise instructions on continuing training. The owner must provide video evidence of all required skills on a friend or family member’s animal or one in a shelter prior to the release of the service animal. Owner has 6 weeks after graduating the training program to exhibit these skills at $25 a week for fostering during this time. Failure of owner to show mastery of these skills will result in permanent forfeiture of the animal to the trainer.

In order to have an animal of any kind, a stable environment is required. This is especially true of anyone with a medical condition, as this can impact the severity of the condition and frequency of flare-ups. Owner must have an address of their own for a minimum of 60 days prior to the release of the service animal. Fees after graduating from the training program until release will be $25/week while owner obtains this environment. If owner does not have this environment within 6 months of graduating from the program, animal will be forfeit to the trainer permanently. 

Uncontrolled blood sugar cannot be accurately alerted to by any animal. In order for a diabetic alert animal to graduate into the Alert and Series Skills, blood sugar must average below 150 with high alerts being at 180 and low alerts being at 100, and owner must be under active supervision of a physician. A1C must be a 7 or lower in order to qualify for graduation with this information being presented with a copy of the blood results to the trainer. As service animal must be able to alert to these levels, failure of owner to obtain these levels within 6 months of the completion of Intermediate Obedience will result in the animal being released from the program entirely, with payment required in full for release to owner, or animal will be forfeited to the trainer. During the waiting period, the regular weekly rate will apply.
## Training Requirements after Release
Any and all service dogs require ongoing training to maintain their skills. Formal training sessions must occur at least once a week using the training manual that will be provided at release of the service animal.

It is the responsibility of the owner to contact the trainer with all questions pertaining to the animal’s training after their release. It is possible that remote video training sessions will need to be booked with the trainer for these instances. Fees for these training sessions will be added to the weekly training and fostering fees and will be paid according to the payment schedule.
## Fee Schedule
All payments for training and fostering will be paid according to the fee schedule below. Payments will be recorded and made a minimum of once a month with a minimum monthly payment of $100 until all fees are paid in full.

Payment plan may continue after the release of the animal to the owner’s care, if not paid in full by this time and unless otherwise stated in this contract, but repossession of the animal is authorized if any payments are missed.

If training is canceled for any reason and owner is unable to pay the balance immediately, owner has 6 weeks to pay the balance with an additional fee of $25 a week. If the balance at the end of six weeks has not been paid, ownership of the animal is forfeited to the trainer.

Weekly training and fostering: $50
Cost for release due to travel: $1/mile one way + $50/day
Cost for 1 week training at fostering residence 5x: $250 each
Cost for Canine Good Citizenship testing: determined by testing facility
Video training sessions: $25 per 30 minute session, maximum 1 hour at a time

All fees will be communicated via email invoice on a monthly basis and will be available to review on a designated website for all training updates.
## Refund Policy
As the service animal must pass certain tests, the owner must exhibit certain skills prior to the release of the service animal, and the owner must continue the training of the service animal after their release, there will be no refunds afforded for any service animal for any reason.
## Cancellation of Training
With the requirement of samples being sent to the trainer when requested, failure to return the samples to the trainer will result in a forfeiture of the training and the animal will not be qualified to be a service dog. 

Some animals do not possess the temperament to be a service animal. This will be determined within the time that Basic Obedience is completed. If an animal is determined to not be suited for a service animal, training may continue to Canine Good Citizenship if desired, but will not progress past this level.

Cancellation of training for any reason will result in certification of training not being provided as training is not complete and animal will only be released to owner with payment in full to date at that time.
## Risk of Loss Statement
As with any living creature, there is a risk that the animal will have a medical emergency and may not pull through. The trainer will be held harmless if such an instance does occur. The trainer may not be sued for any monetary damages and any and all fees paid to date will be forfeited, but training may be moved to another service animal without incurring additional fees for the repeated training, as long as the replacement animal abides by the same training timeline as the original.
